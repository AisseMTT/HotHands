# HotHands

In basketball, the "hot hands effect" is a supposed phenomenon in which a person who makes several successful baskets in a row experiences a greater probability of scoring in further attempts. 

For example, a player who has "made" three sucessful baskets in a row is considered to have a higher probability of making a 4th basket than if they had just missed a shot. 

This project uses Golden State Warriors game data to calculate Tversky statistic for a certain player (Klay Thompson).
